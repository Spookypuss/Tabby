I'm spooky, but not really a puss.  But I did live with a spooky black puss called Oscar, and she would stare at me from 
strange places, and all I could see were her eyes.  Like sitting on the middle of a sash window, at night.  Or staring from a 
bookshelf.  It was creepy and would make me jump.

I name myself in her honour as she was a weirdo, a chubster, and a really whiney creature.  What a hero.
